Logo Placeholder Images

Since we can't directly create image files through this interface, this file serves as a placeholder.
In a real implementation, you would need to add the following logo images to this directory:

1. redhat.png - Red Hat logo
2. aws.png - Amazon Web Services logo
3. udemy.png - Udemy logo
4. ztm.png - Zero To Mastery Academy logo
5. coursera.png - Coursera logo
6. deeplearning.png - DeepLearning.AI logo
7. offensive-security.png - Offensive Security logo
8. datacamp.png - DataCamp logo
9. scrum-alliance.png - Scrum Alliance logo

For testing purposes, you can use placeholder images from:
- https://placehold.co/150x150?text=Logo+Name
- Or download the actual logos from the respective company websites

Remember to adjust the image paths in certificatesData.js if you use different filenames or paths.
